My Entry for the 33rd Ludum Dare contest. Titled "Stomp This City".

For more information, please see: https://louisfellows.com/games/ld33-stomp-this-city/

Please excuse the lack of comments etc in the code. This game was developed from scratch over a 48 hour period and is my first efforts both with Unity and in 3D!
